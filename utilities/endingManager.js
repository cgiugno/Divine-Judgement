        "You were cast out of the home of the gods, as is the traditional punishment for arrogance, blasphemy, and becoming powerful enough to make a group of immortal beings nervous.",
        "Bad things happen to mortals that have beauty to rival the gods. And yet...you're actually rather pleased by your new existence as a garden snail. Sure, there's the constant threat of death from predators and starvation, but it still beats making choices for the gods.",
        "Well, you finally did it. After all this time, you are now an immortal being. Time to kick back, relax, and-- oh, gods, you forgot to ask for eternal youth,",
        "Who would have thought starting a war between the gods would be a bad idea? Not you! And now it's going to be an extremely awkward boat ride across the river of the dead.",

        "'Well', your last thoughts go, 'Can't exactly say that this is a surprise, given that I'm the only squishy human in a realm of all-powerful gods. At least I hear the underworld is nice this time of-",
        "Does it surprise you that the gods are shallow? No. But you are somewhat annoyed that one of their criteria for adequate beauty is eternal youth, which of course you don't have. And that 'I don't want to look at the ugly human' is considered a valid reason for not feeding you.",
        "Death comes for us all. In your case, she is the young woman with a scythe who leans down and speaks in your ear, 'Come with me.'\n'Where are you taking me?' you ask. She mmms quietly, then finally says 'Nowhere bad.' That is enough. You close your hand around hers, and, without opening your eyes, you go there.",
        "Following the gods back to earth would have been a smart idea-- if you hadn't realized far too late that earth is pretty big. And that, while gods can float, mortals are sadly not immune to the effects of gravity.",

    "It has been a decade-- or has it been many? Your gnarled feet scrape against the stones of the road that snakes down from the mountaintop to the village below. At the gate of the village is a small child, staring at you in the gloom. He looks up at you, and, asks hesitantly, 'Are you...a god? My father says they sometimes seek hospitality in the guise of the old and weary.' And you laugh and laugh and laugh.",
